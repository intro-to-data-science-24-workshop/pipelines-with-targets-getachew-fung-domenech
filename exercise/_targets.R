# Created by use_targets().
# Follow the comments below to fill in this target script.
# Then follow the manual to check and run the pipeline:
#   https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html#inspect-the-pipeline

# Load packages required to define the pipeline:
library(targets)
library(tidyverse)

# Set target options:
tar_option_set(
  packages = c("tibble") # Packages that your targets need for their tasks.
)

# Run the R scripts in the R/ folder with your custom functions:
tar_source()
# tar_source("other_functions.R") # Source other scripts as needed.

# Replace the target list below with your own:
list(
  tar_target(
    name = data,
    command = iris
  ),
  tar_target(
    name = summary,
    command = ##Insert here: What would you need to write here to add the relevant function from functions.R that summarises data?
  ),
  tar_target(
    name = histogram,
    command = plot_histogram(data))
  )
