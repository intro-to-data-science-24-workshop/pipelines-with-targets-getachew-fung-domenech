# How to use the package targets


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a student-run session on how to use to handle pipelines with the package targets that is part of the [IDS Tools for Data Science workshop 2024](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in October 2024. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2024.

### Session contents

This session will introduce the targets package and demonstrate how it can help you efficiently organize your data pipeline. A pipeline refers to the structured process that transforms raw data into meaningful results.

Data wrangling is one of the core steps in the data science workflow. dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges, including the manipulation of datasets and variables.

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) introduce the difference between managing your pipeline with and without the targets package, (2) show you the key functions of the package, (3) explain the structure of files and folders needed to run the package, and (4) provide practice material for your reference.


## Tutorial
